# PostgreSQL

## Installation in Mac M1 using homebrew

```bash
brew install postgresql@15
```

Start the psql

```bash
brew services start postgresql@15
```

Open the postgresql CLI

```bash
psql postgres # postgress is a username
```

Set password to default user, prompts for password, enter the password

```bash
postgres=# \password <user-name>
```

### Create a Role with a query

```bash
postgres=# CREATE ROLE test WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

Created role is valid in all databases in the database server (or cluster).
List all the roles created using,

```bash
postgres=# \du
```

- Query the roles created√ü using,

```bash
SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles;
```

Created roles don't have any attributes attched to it, add the `CREATEDB` permission to the new role/user created.

```bash
postgres=# ALTER ROLE test CREATEDB; 
```

Verify that test role got permission to create the database, [ALTER ROLE documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterrole.html)

### Create a Role with createuser client application

- Postgres supports [client applications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/reference-client.html) to reduce the friction to create user or db using the syntax `CREATE ROLE ...`

Create a user test with permissions to create a DB

```bash
postgres=# createuser test --createdb
```

### Login with a created role

Prompts for password enter the password to login (`postgres` is a default databse)

```bash
psql -U user-name postgres
```

### Create a DB with a query

Create a DB

```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE test;
```

Once DB created, add at least one user who has permission to access the database.

```bash
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE test TO test;
```

List the created databses

```bash
postgres=# \l
```

Select a database after login (database can be specified while loging in as well)

```bash
postgres=# \c database-name
```

## Drop a role - If a role owns a database but you want to delete that role

```bash
REASSIGN OWNED BY test TO <newuser>;

# or use this
DROP OWNED BY test;
```

### Revoke all the privileges

```bash
REVOKE  ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE music FROM test;
```

### drop the role

```bash
DROP ROLE TEST;
```

## Copy csv data to table

```bash
test=# \copy track_raw(title, artist, album, count, rating, len) FROM 'library.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;
# track-raw is the table name to which we are loading the data
```

Make sure to create the table before copying it, get the `library.csv` from here,

```bash
curl -O https://www.pg4e.com/tools/sql/library.csv # if curl not present, use wget
wget https://www.pg4e.com/tools/sql/library.csv
```
