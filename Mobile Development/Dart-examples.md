## Dart Programming basics and Sample Examples

### Importing packages

- Importing packages
  ```javascript
  import 'dart:io';
  // Needs to add pubspec.yaml file to specify the dependency
  import 'package:meta/meta.dart';
  ```

### Example `pubspec.yaml`

- Sample yaml file
  ```yaml
  name: my_sample_app
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    Sample dart app for learing purpose
  author: Punith K
  dependencies:
    meta: ^1.1.7
  ```

### Variables

- Different variable types
  ```javascript
  var name = 'Punith';
  var intNumber = 23;
  var floatNumber = 2.4;
  var arrayData = ['Punith', 25, 33];
  var objectSample = {'name': 'Punith', 'age': 23};
  var year = 2019;
  var isTrue = true;
  ```

- `final` variables cannot be changed
  ```javascript
  final String bob = 'Uncle bob';
  final bob = 'Bob';
  ```

- A `final` variable can be set only once; a `const` variable is a compile-time constant.

- `const` variables are `implicitly final`. A final top-level or class variable is initialized the first time itâ€™s used.

- Use `const` for variables that you want to be `compile-time constants`. If the const variable is at the `class level`, mark it `static const`.
Where you declare the variable, set the value to a compile-time constant such as a number or string literal, a const variable, or the result of an arithmetic operation on constant numbers:
  ```javascript
  const bar = 1000000; // Unit of pressure (dynes/cm2)
  const double atm = 1.01325 * bar; //  Standard atmosphere
  ```

- The `const` keyword isnâ€™t just for declaring constant variables. You can also use it to create constant values, as well as to `declare constructors` that create constant values. Any variable can have a constant value.
  ```javascript
  var foo = const [];
  final bar1 = const [];
  const baz = []; // Equivalent to `const []`
  ```

- You can omit `const` from the initializing expression of a const declaration, like for baz above.

- You can change the value of a `non-final, non-const` variable, even if it used to have a const value.

- You canâ€™t change the value of a const variable

### Built-in types

- The Dart language has special support for the following types:
  - Numbers
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - Lists (also known as Arrays)
  - Sets
  - Maps
  - Runes (for expressing Unicode characters in a string)
  - Symbols

#### Numbers

- Numbers have 2 flavours

  - int - Integer values no larger than 64 bits, depending on the platform.
    - On the Dart VM, values can be from `-2^63 to 2^63-1`.
    - Dart thatâ€™s compiled to `JavaScript` uses JavaScript numbers, allowing values from `-2^53 to 2^53-1`.
    - Integers are numbers without a decimal point.
    ```javascript
    var x = 1;
    var hex = 0xDEADBEEF;
    ```

  - double -` 64-bit` (double-precision) floating-point numbers, as specified by the `IEEE-754` standard.
    - Both int and double are subtypes of num.
    - If a number includes a decimal, it is a double.
    ```javascript
    var y = 1.1;
    var exponents = 1.42e5;
    ```

- As of `Dart 2.1`, integer literals are `automatically converted to doubles` when necessary
  ```javascript
  double z = 1; //  Equivalent to double z = 1.0.
  ```

#### Convert string into a number, or vice versa

- Conversion of a string to number or vice versa
  ```javascript
  // String to int
  var one = int.parse('1');

  // String to double
  var onePointOne = double.parse('1.1');

  // int to String
  String oneAsString = 1.toString();

  // double -> String
  String piAsString = 3.14159.toStringAsFixed(2);
  ```

- Put the value of an expression inside a string by using `${expression}`.

- If the expression is an `identifier`, you can `skip the {}`. To get the string corresponding to an object, Dart calls the objectâ€™s `toString()` method.
  ```javascript
  var s = 'string interpolation';
  ```

- Create a `multi-line` string: use a `triple quote` with either single or double quotation marks
  ```javascript
  var s1 = '''
  You can create
  multi-line strings like this one.
  ''';

  var s2 = """This is also a
  multi-line string.""";
  ```

- Create a `raw` string by prefixing it with `r`
  ```javascript
  var rawStr = r'In a raw string, not even \n gets special treatment.';
  ```

### Lists

- Perhaps the most common collection in nearly every programming language is the array, or ordered group of objects.

- In Dart, arrays are List objects, so most people just call them lists.

- Dart list literals look like JavaScript array literals.
  ```javascript
  var list = [1, 2, 3];
  ```
- Dart `infers` that list has type `List<int>`.

- If you try to add non-integer objects to this list, the analyzer or runtime raises an error

#### Spread Operator(...)

- Spread operator to copy the data from one arrray to another, like the one in JavaScript
  ```javascript
  var list2 = [0, ...list];
  ```

- If the expression to the `right of the spread operator might be null`, you can avoid exceptions by using a `null-aware spread operator ...?`.
  ```
  var nullList;
  var list3 = [0, ...?nullList];
  ```

- `Dart 2.3` introduced `collection if` and `collection for`, which you can use to build collections using `conditionals if` and `repetition for`.

  - Hereâ€™s an example of using `collection if` to create a list with three or four items in it
    ```javascript
    var promoActive = true;
    var nav = ['Home', 'Furniture', 'Plants', if (promoActive) 'Outlet'];
    ```

  - Hereâ€™s an example of using `collection for` to manipulate the items of a list before adding them to another list
  ```javascript
  var listOfInts = [1, 2, 3];
  var listOfStrings = ['#0', for (var i in listOfInts) '#$i'];
  ```

### Sets

- A set in Dart is an `unordered collection of unique items`.

- Dart support for sets is provided by set literals and the Set type.
  ```javascript
  var halogens = {'fluorine', 'chlorine', 'bromine', 'iodine', 'astatine'};
  ```

- To create an empty set, use `{}` preceded by a `type argument`, or assign {} to a variable of type Set.
  ```javascript
  var names = <String>{};
  Set<String> names = {}; // This works, too.
  var names = {}; // Creates a map, not a set.
  ```
- `Set or map?` The syntax for map literals is similar to that for set literals. Because map literals came first, `{} defaults to the Map` type.

- If you forget the type annotation on {} or the variable itâ€™s assigned to, then Dart creates an object of type` Map<dynamic, dynamic>`.

- Add items to an existing set using the `add()` or `addAll()` methods
  ```JavaScript
  var elements = <String>{};
  elements.addAll(halogens);
  elements.add('fluorine');
  ```

- Use `.length` to get the number of items in the set.

- Dart `infers` that halogens has the `type Set<String>`.

- If you try to add the wrong type of value to the set, the analyzer or runtime raises an error.

- To create a set thatâ€™s a `compile-time constant`, add const before the set literal
  ```javascript
  final constantSet = const {
  'fluorine',
  'chlorine',
  'bromine',
  'iodine',
  'astatine',
  };
  ```

### Maps

- A map is an object that associates `keys and values`.

- Both keys and values can be any type of object. Each `key occurs only once`, but you can use the same value multiple times.

- Dart support for maps is provided by map literals and the Map type.
  ```javascript
  var nobleGases = {
    2: 'helium',
    10: 'neon',
    18: 'argon',
  };
  ```

- Dart `infers` that nobleGases has the `type Map<int, String>`.

- If you try to add the wrong type of value to either map, the analyzer or runtime raises an error

- Create the same objects using a Map constructor
  ```javascript
  var nobleGases1 = Map();
  ```

- You might expect to see `new Map()` instead of just Map(). As of` Dart 2, the new keyword is optional`.

-  Both map and sets support, `... and ...?` and collection if and for, just like lists do.

### Runes

- In Dart, runes are the `UTF-32` code points of a string.

- Unicode defines a unique numeric value for each letter, digit, and symbol used in all of the worldâ€™s writing systems.

- Because a `Dart string` is a sequence of `UTF-16 code units`, expressing 32-bit Unicode values within a string requires special syntax.

- The usual way to express a Unicode code point is `\uXXXX`, where XXXX is a 4-digit hexadecimal value.
  - For example, the heart character (â™¥) is \u2665.

- To specify more or less than 4 hex digits, place the value in curly brackets.
  - For example, the laughing emoji (ðŸ˜†) is \u{1f600}.
  ```javascript
  var clapping = '\u{1f44f}';
  print(clapping);
  print(clapping.codeUnits);
  print(clapping.runes.toList());
  Runes input = new Runes(
      '\u2665  \u{1f605}  \u{1f60e}  \u{1f47b}  \u{1f596}  \u{1f44d}');
  print(new String.fromCharCodes(input));
  ```

### Functions

- Dart is a `true object-oriented` language, so even `functions are objects` and have a type, Function.
This means that functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.

- You can also call an instance of a Dart class as if it were a function.
  ```javascript
  int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
  ```

- Using arrow syntax
  ```javascript
  bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) => nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
  ```

- A function can have two types of `parameters`: `required and optional`. The required parameters are `listed first`, followed by any optional parameters.

- Named optional parameters can also be marked as `@required`.

#### Optional parameters

- Optional parameters can be either `positional or named`, but not both.

##### Optional named parameters

- When calling a function, you can specify named parameters using `paramName: value`.
  ```javascript
  enableFlags(bold: true, hidden: false);
  ```

- When defining a function, use `{param1, param2, â€¦}` to specify `named parameters`
  ```javascript
  // Sets the [bold] and [hidden] flags ...
  void enableFlags({bool bold, @required bool hidden}) {
  }
  ```

- `@required` annotation is defined in the meta package. `import package:meta/meta.dart` directly.

##### Optional positional parameters

- Wrapping a set of function `parameters in []` marks them as `optional positional` parameters:
  ```javascript
  String say(String from, String msg, [String device]) {
    var result = '$from says $msg';
    if (device != null) {
      result = '$result with a $device';
    }
    return result;
  }
  ```

#### Default parameter values

- Function can use `= to define default values` for both named and positional parameters.

- The `default values must be compile-time constants`. If no default value is provided, the` default value is null`.
  ```javascript
  // Sets the [bold] and [hidden] flags ...
  void enableFlags1({bool bold = false, bool hidden = false}) {}
  ```

### Lexical scope

- Dart is a `lexically scoped` language, which means that the `scope of variables` is `determined statically`.

#### Lexical closures

- A closure is a `function object` that has `access to variables in its lexical scope`, even when the function is used outside of its original scope.

- Functions can close over variables defined in surrounding scopes.
  ```javascript
  // Returns a function that adds [addBy] to the function's argument.
  Function makeAdder(num addBy) {
    return (num i) => addBy + i;
  }
  ```

### Operators

- List of special operators supported in Dart
  - if null: `??`
  - Cascade: `..`
  - Relational and type test: `>=, >, <=, <, as, is, and is!`
  - Divide, returning an integer result: `~/`

- Use the `as operator` to cast an object to a particular type.

- In general, you should use it as a shorthand for an is test on an object following by an expression using that object.
  ```javascript
  if (emp is Person) {  // Type check
   emp.firstName = 'Bob';
  }
  // You can make the code shorter using the as operator:
  (emp as Person).firstName = 'Bob';
  ```

#### Assignment operators

- Assign values using the = operator.
- To assign only if the assigned-to `variable is null`, use the `??=` operator.
  ```
  // Assign value to a
  a = value;
  // Assign value to b if b is null; otherwise, b stays the same
  b ??= value;
  ```

#### Conditional expressions

- Dart has two operators that let you concisely evaluate expressions that might otherwise require if-else statements

- If condition is true, evaluates expr1 (and returns its value); otherwise, evaluates and returns the value of expr2.
  ```
  condition ? expr1 : expr2
  ```

- If expr1 is non-null, returns its value; otherwise, evaluates and returns the value of expr2.
  ```
  expr1 ?? expr2
  ```

- When you need to assign a value based on a boolean expression, consider using `?:`
  ```javascript
  var visibility = isTrue ? 'public' : 'private';
  ```

- If the boolean expression tests for null, consider using `??`
  ```
  String playerName(String name) => name ?? 'Guest';
  ```

#### Cascade notation (..)

- Cascades `..` allow you to make a `sequence of operations` on the same object. In addition to function calls, you can also access fields on that same object.

- This often saves you the step of creating a temporary variable and allows you to write more fluid code.
  ```javascript
  querySelector('#confirm') -  Get an object.
    ..text = 'Confirm' -  Use its members.
    ..classes.add('important')
    ..onClick.listen((e) => window.alert('Confirmed!'));
    ```

- The previous example is equivalent to:
  ```javascript
  var button = querySelector('#confirm');
  button.text = 'Confirm';
  button.classes.add('important');
  button.onClick.listen((e) => window.alert('Confirmed!'));
  ```

- Cascades can be nested. For example:
  ```javascript
  final addressBook = (AddressBookBuilder()
      ..name = 'jenny'
      ..email = 'jenny@example.com'
      ..phone = (PhoneNumberBuilder()
            ..number = '415-555-0100'
            ..label = 'home')
          .build())
    .build();
    ```

### Switch and Case

- Switch statements in Dart compare `integer`, `string`, or `compile-time constants` using `==`.

- The compared objects must all be instances of the same class (and not of any of its subtypes), and the class `must not override ==`.

- `Enumerated` types work well in switch statements.

### Exceptions

- All of Dartâ€™s exceptions are `unchecked exceptions`. Dart provides `Exception` and `Error` types, as well as numerous predefined subtypes.
You can, of course, define your own exceptions.

- However, Dart programs can throw any `non-null object`â€” not just Exception and `Error objects`â€” as an exception.

- Hereâ€™s an example of throwing, or raising, an exception:
  ```javascript
  throw FormatException('Expected at least 1 section');
  // You can also throw arbitrary objects
  throw 'Out of llamas!';
  ```

- Production-quality code usually throws types that implement `Error` or `Exception`.

- To raise an exception, use `throw`
  ```javascript
  if (year == 0) {
    throw StateError('No astronauts.');
  }
  ```

- To catch an exception, use a `try` statement with `on or catch` (or both):
  ```javascript
  void catchException() async {
    try {
      for (var object in arrayData) {
        var description = await File('$object.txt').readAsString();
        print(description);
      }
    } on IOException catch (e) {
      print('Could not describe object: $e');
    } finally {
      arrayData.clear();
    }
  }
  ```

- Catching, or capturing, an exception stops the exception from propagating
  ```javascript
  try {
    breedMoreLlamas();
  } on OutOfLlamasException {
    buyMoreLlamas();
  }
  ```

- To handle code that can `throw more than one type` of exception, you can specify `multiple catch` clauses. The first catch clause that matches the thrown objectâ€™s type handles the exception. If the catch clause does not specify a type, that clause can handle any type of thrown object:
  ```javascript
  try {
    breedMoreLlamas();
  } on OutOfLlamasException {
    // A specific exception
    buyMoreLlamas();
  } on Exception catch (e) {
    // Anything else that is an exception
    print('Unknown exception: $e');
  } catch (e) {
    // No specified type, handles all
    print('Something really unknown: $e');
  }
  ```

- Use `catch()` when your exception handler needs the exception object. You can specify `one or two parameters` to `catch()`.
  ```javascript
  try {
    // Â·Â·Â·
  } on Exception catch (e) {
    print('Exception details:\n $e');
  } catch (e, s) {
    print('Exception details:\n $e');
    print('Stack trace:\n $s');
  }
  ```

- To partially handle an exception, while allowing it to propagate, use the `rethrow` keyword.
  ```javascript
  void misbehave() {
    try {
      dynamic foo = true;
      print(foo++); // Runtime error
    } catch (e) {
      print('misbehave() partially handled ${e.runtimeType}.');
      rethrow; // Allow callers to see the exception.
    }
  }

  void main() {
    try {
      misbehave();
    } catch (e) {
      print('main() finished handling ${e.runtimeType}.');
    }
  }
  ```

- To ensure that some code runs whether or not an exception is thrown, use a `finally` clause. If no catch clause matches the exception, the exception is propagated after the finally clause runs
  ```javascript
  try {
    breedMoreLlamas();
  } finally {
    // Always clean up, even if an exception is thrown.
    cleanLlamaStalls();
  }
  ```

- The `finally` clause runs after any matching catch clauses
  ```javascript
  try {
    breedMoreLlamas();
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e'); // Handle the exception first.
  } finally {
    cleanLlamaStalls(); // Then clean up.
  }
  ```

### Classes

- Dart is an object-oriented language with classes and` mixin-based inheritance`. Every object is an instance of a class,
and all classes `descend from Object`. Mixin-based inheritance means that although
every class (except for Object) has `exactly one superclass`, a class body can be reused in multiple class hierarchies.


#### Using class members

- Objects have members consisting of `functions` and `data` (methods and instance variables, respectively).
When you call a method, you invoke it on an object: the method has access to that objectâ€™s functions and data.

- Use a `dot (.)` to refer to an instance variable or method:
  ```javascript
  var p = Point(2, 2); // Where Point is a class
  // Set the value of the instance variable y.
  p.y = 3;

  // Invoke distanceTo() on p.
  num distance = p.distanceTo(Point(4, 4));
  ```

- Use `?.` instead of . to avoid an `exception when the leftmost operand is null`
  ```
  // If p is non-null, set its y value to 4.
  p?.y = 4;
  ```

#### Using constructors

- You can create an object using a constructor. Constructor names can be either `ClassName` or `ClassName.identifier`.
`new` keyword is optional in `Dart 2`.  
  ```javascript
  var p1 = Point(2, 2);
  var p2 = Point.fromJson({'x': 1, 'y': 2});
  ```

- Some classes provide `constant constructors`. To create a compile-time constant using a `constant` constructor, put the `const` keyword before the constructor name
  ```javascript
  var p = const ImmutablePoint(2, 2);
  ```

- Constructing `two identical compile-time constants` results in a `single, canonical instance`
  ```javascript
  var a = const ImmutablePoint(1, 1);
  var b = const ImmutablePoint(1, 1);
  ```

- Within a constant context, you can `omit the const` before a constructor or literal.
For example, look at this code, which creates a const map
  ```javascript
  // Lots of const keywords here.
  const pointAndLine = const {
    'point': const [const ImmutablePoint(0, 0)],
    'line': const [const ImmutablePoint(1, 10), const ImmutablePoint(-2, 11)],
  };

  // You can omit all but the first use of the const keyword
  // Only one const, which establishes the constant context.
  const pointAndLine = {
    'point': [ImmutablePoint(0, 0)],
    'line': [ImmutablePoint(1, 10), ImmutablePoint(-2, 11)],
  };
  ```

- If a constant constructor is outside of a constant context and is `invoked without const`, it creates a `non-constant object`
  ```javascript
  var a = const ImmutablePoint(1, 1); // Creates a constant
  var b = ImmutablePoint(1, 1); // Does NOT create a constant
  ```
#### Getting an objectâ€™s type

- To get an objectâ€™s type at runtime, you can use Objectâ€™s `runtimeType` property, which returns a Type object.
  ```javascript
  print('The type of a is ${a.runtimeType}');
  ```

#### Instance variables

- Hereâ€™s how you declare instance variables:
  ```javascript
  class Point {
    num x; // Declare instance variable x, initially null.
    num y; // Declare y, initially null.
    num z = 0; // Declare z, initially 0.
  }
  ```
- All uninitialized instance variables have the value `null`.

- All `instance variables` generate an `implicit getter method`.` Non-final instance variables` also generate an `implicit setter` method.
  ```javascript
  void main() {
    var point = Point();
    point.x = 4; // Use the setter method for x.
    print(point.x); // Use the getter method for x.
    print(point.y); // Values default to null.
  }
  ```

- Initializing an instance variable where it is declared (instead of in a constructor or method), the value is set when the instance is created, which is `before the constructor` and its initializer list execute.

#### Constructors

- Declare a constructor by creating a function with the `same name as its class`. The most common form of constructor, the generative constructor, creates a new instance of a class
  ```javascript
  class Point {
    num x, y;

    Point(num x, num y) {
      // this keyword refers to the current instance.
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }

    // Syntactic sugar for setting x and y
    // before the constructor body runs.
    Point(this.x, this.y);
  }
  ```

#### Default constructors

- If you donâ€™t declare a constructor, a `default constructor` is provided for you. The default constructor `has no arguments` and invokes the no-argument constructor in the superclass. Constructors arenâ€™t inherited

- `Subclasses donâ€™t inherit` constructors from their `superclass`. A subclass that declares no constructors has only the default (no argument, no name) constructor.

#### Named constructors

- Use a named constructor to implement `multiple constructors` for a class or to provide extra clarity
  ```javascript
  Point.origin() {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
  }
  ```

- `superclassâ€™s named constructor` is `not inherited` by a `subclass`. If you want a subclass to be created with a named constructor defined in the superclass, you must implement that constructor in the subclass.

#### Invoking a non-default superclass constructor

- By default, a constructor in a subclass calls the `superclassâ€™s unnamed, no-argument constructor`. The superclassâ€™s constructor is called at the beginning of the constructor body. If an initializer list is also being used, it executes before the superclass is called. In summary, the order of execution is as follows:
  - initializer list
  - superclassâ€™s no-arg constructor
  - main classâ€™s no-arg constructor

- If the superclass doesnâ€™t have an unnamed, no-argument constructor, then you must manually call one of the constructors in the superclass. Specify the superclass constructor after `a colon (:)`, just before the constructor body (if any).
  ```javascript
  class Employee extends Person {
    Employee() : super.fromJson(getDefaultData());
  }
  ```

- `Arguments` to the superclass constructor` do not have access` to `this`. For example, arguments `can call static methods` but `not instance methods`.

#### Initializer list

- Besides invoking a superclass constructor, you can also `initialize instance variables` before the constructor body runs. Separate initializers with commas.
  ```javascript
  // Initializer list sets instance variables before
  // the constructor body runs.
  Point.fromJson(Map<String, num> json)
      : x = json['x'],
        y = json['y'] {
    print('In Point.fromJson(): ($x, $y)');
  }
  ```

#### Constant constructors

- If your class produces objects that never change, you can make these objects `compile-time constants`. To do this, define a `const` constructor and make sure that` all instance variables are final`.
  ```javascript
  class ImmutablePoint {
    static final ImmutablePoint origin =
        const ImmutablePoint(0, 0);

    final num x, y;

    const ImmutablePoint(this.x, this.y);
  }
  ```

- Constant constructors donâ€™t always create constants

#### Factory constructors

- Use the `factory` keyword when implementing a constructor that doesnâ€™t always create a new instance of its class.
For example, a factory constructor might return an instance from a cache, or it might return an instance of a subtype.

- The following example demonstrates a factory constructor returning objects from a cache:
  ```javascript
  class Logger {
    final String name;
    bool mute = false;

    // _cache is library-private
    static final Map<String, Logger> _cache =
        <String, Logger>{};

    factory Logger(String name) {
      if (_cache.containsKey(name)) {
        return _cache[name];
      } else {
        final logger = Logger._internal(name);
        _cache[name] = logger;
        return logger;
      }
    }

    Logger._internal(this.name);

    void log(String msg) {
      if (!mute) print(msg);
    }
  }
  ```

- Factory constructors have `no access` to `this`.

- Invoke a `factory constructor` just like you would any other constructor
  ```javascript
  var logger = Logger('UI');
  logger.log('Button clicked');
  ```

### Methods

- Methods are `functions` that provide behavior for an object.

#### Instance methods

- Instance methods on objects can `access instance variables` and `this`.
  ```javascript
  import 'dart:math';

  class Point {
    num x, y;

    Point(this.x, this.y);

    num distanceTo(Point other) {
      var dx = x - other.x;
      var dy = y - other.y;
      return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
  }
  ```

#### Getters and setters

- Getters and setters are special methods that provide read and write access to an objectâ€™s properties.
implement getters and setters, using the `get` and `set` keywords
  ```javascript
  class Rectangle {
    num left, top, width, height;

    Rectangle(this.left, this.top, this.width, this.height);

    // Define two calculated properties: right and bottom.
    num get right => left + width;
    set right(num value) => left = value - width;
    num get bottom => top + height;
    set bottom(num value) => top = value - height;
  }
  ```

#### Abstract methods

- `Instance, getter, and setter methods` can be `abstract`, defining an interface but leaving its implementation up to other classes.
Abstract methods can only exist in abstract classes.

- To make a method abstract, use a `semicolon (;)` instead of a method body:
  ```javascript
  abstract class Doer {
    // Define instance variables and methods...
    void doSomething(); // Define an abstract method.
  }

  class EffectiveDoer extends Doer {
    void doSomething() {
      // Provide an implementation, so the method is not abstract here...
    }
  }
  ```

#### Abstract classes

- Use the `abstract` modifier to define an abstract class â€” a class that `canâ€™t be instantiated`.
Abstract classes are useful for `defining interfaces`, often with some implementation. If you want your abstract class to appear to be instantiable, `define a factory constructor`.

- Abstract classes often have `abstract methods`.

#### Implicit interfaces

- Every class `implicitly defines` an `interface` containing all the `instance members of the class` and of any interfaces it implements.
If you want to create a class A that supports class Bâ€™s API without inheriting Bâ€™s implementation, class A should implement the B interface.

- A class `implements one or more interfaces` by declaring them in an implements clause and then providing the APIs required by the interfaces.
  ```javascript
  // A person. The implicit interface contains greet().
  class Person {
    // In the interface, but visible only in this library.
    final _name;

    // Not in the interface, since this is a constructor.
    Person(this._name);

    // In the interface.
    String greet(String who) => 'Hello, $who. I am $_name.';
  }

  // An implementation of the Person interface.
  class Impostor implements Person {
    get _name => '';

    String greet(String who) => 'Hi $who. Do you know who I am?';
  }

  String greetBob(Person person) => person.greet('Bob');

  void main() {
    print(greetBob(Person('Kathy')));
    print(greetBob(Impostor()));
  }
  ```

- Class implementing `multiple interfaces`
  ```javascript
  class Point implements Comparable, Location {
  }
  ```

#### Extending a class

- Use `extends` to create a subclass, and `super` to refer to the superclass
  ```javascript
  class Television {
    void turnOn() {
      _illuminateDisplay();
      _activateIrSensor();
    }
  }

  class SmartTelevision extends Television {
    void turnOn() {
      super.turnOn();
      _bootNetworkInterface();
      _initializeMemory();
      _upgradeApps();
    }
  }
  ```

#### Overriding members

- Subclasses can override `instance methods, getters, and setters`. You can use the `@override` annotation to indicate that you are intentionally overriding a member.
  ```javascript
  class SmartTelevision extends Television {
    @override
    void turnOn() {
    }
  }
  ```

#### Overridable operators

- You can override the `operators` shown in the following table.
  ```javascript
  <,	+, 	|, 	[],  >, 	/, 	^, 	[]=,  <=, 	~/, 	&, 	~, >=, 	*, 	<<, 	==,  â€“,  	%, 	>>
  ```

- `!=` is not an overridable operator.

- Hereâ€™s an example of a class that overrides the `+ and -` operators:
  ```javascript
  class Vector {
    final int x, y;

    Vector(this.x, this.y);

    Vector operator +(Vector v) => Vector(x + v.x, y + v.y);
    Vector operator -(Vector v) => Vector(x - v.x, y - v.y);
  }

  void main() {
    final v = Vector(2, 3);
    final w = Vector(2, 2);

    assert(v + w == Vector(4, 5));
    assert(v - w == Vector(0, 1));
  }
  ```

#### noSuchMethod()

- To detect or react whenever code attempts to use a `non-existent method` or `instance variable`, you can override `noSuchMethod()`
  ```javascript
  class A {
    // Unless you override noSuchMethod, using a
    // non-existent member results in a NoSuchMethodError.
    @override
    void noSuchMethod(Invocation invocation) {
      print('You tried to use a non-existent member: ' +
          '${invocation.memberName}');
    }
  }
  ```

- You canâ€™t invoke an `unimplemented method` unless one of the following is true
  - The receiver has the `static type dynamic`.
  - The receiver has a static type that defines the `unimplemented method` (abstract is OK),
  and the dynamic type of the receiver has an implementation of `noSuchMethod()` thatâ€™s different from the one in class Object.

#### Enumerated types

- Enumerated types, often called `enumerations` or enums, are a special kind of class used to represent a `fixed number of constant values`.

- Declare an enumerated type using the `enum` keyword
  ```javascript
  enum Color { red, green, blue }
  ```

- Each value in an enum has an `index getter`, which returns the zero-based position of the value in the enum declaration
`Color.red.index` returns 0 and `Color.greeen.index` returns 1 and so on.

- To get a `list of all of the values` in the enum, use the enumâ€™s `values` constant.
  ```javascript
  List<Color> colors = Color.values;
  assert(colors[2] == Color.blue);
  ```

- Enumerated types have the following limits
  - You canâ€™t `subclass`, mix in, or `implement` an enum.
  - You canâ€™t explicitly `instantiate` an enum.

### Adding features to a class: mixins

- Mixins are a way of `reusing a classâ€™s code` in multiple class hierarchies.

- To use a mixin, use the `with` keyword followed by one or more mixin names.

- To implement a mixin, create a class that `extends Object` and declares `no constructors`. Unless you want your mixin to be usable as a regular class, use the `mixin` keyword instead of class.
  ```javascript
  mixin Musical {
    bool canPlayPiano = false;
    bool canCompose = false;
    bool canConduct = false;

    void entertainMe() {
      if (canPlayPiano) {
        print('Playing piano');
      } else if (canConduct) {
        print('Waving hands');
      } else {
        print('Humming to self');
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- To specify that only certain types can use the mixin â€” for example, so your mixin can invoke a method that it doesnâ€™t define â€” use on to specify the required superclass:
  ```javascript
  mixin MusicalPerformer on Musician {
  }
  ```

#### Class variables and methods

- Use the `static` keyword to implement class-wide variables and methods.
  ```javascript
  class Queue {
    static const initialCapacity = 16;
  }

  void main() {
    assert(Queue.initialCapacity == 16);
  }
  ```

- Static variables `arenâ€™t initialized until theyâ€™re used`.

#### Static methods

- Static methods (class methods) `do not operate on an instance`, and thus do not have access to `this`.


### Libraries and visibility

- The `import` and `library` directives can help you create a modular and shareable code base.

- Libraries not only provide APIs, but are a `unit of privacy`: identifiers that start with an `_` are visible only inside the library.

- Every Dart app is a library.
  ```javascript
  // For built-in libraries, the URI has the special dart: scheme
  import 'dart:html';
  //  For other libraries, you can use a file system path or the package: scheme.
  import 'package:test/test.dart';

  // Using prefix
  import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart';
  import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' as lib2;

  // Uses Element from lib1.
  Element element1 = Element();

  // Uses Element from lib2.
  lib2.Element element2 = lib2.Element();

  // Import only foo.
  import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart' show foo;

  // Import all names EXCEPT foo.
  import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' hide foo;
  ```

#### Lazily loading a library

- Deferred loading (also called lazy loading) allows an application to `load a library on demand`, if and when itâ€™s needed.

- Here are some cases when you might use deferred loading:
  - To reduce an appâ€™s initial startup time.
  - To perform A/B testingâ€”trying out alternative implementations of an algorithm, for example.
  - To load rarely used functionality, such as optional screens and dialogs.

- To lazily load a library, you must first import it using `deferred as`.
  ```javascript
  import 'package:greetings/hello.dart' deferred as hello;
  ```

- When you need the library, invoke loadLibrary() using the libraryâ€™s identifier.
  ```javascript
  Future greet() async {
    await hello.loadLibrary();
    hello.printGreeting();
  }
  ```

- In the preceding cthe `await` keyword pauses execution until the library is loaded.

- You can invoke `loadLibrary()` multiple times on a library without problems. The library is loaded only once.

- Keep in mind the following when you use deferred loading
    - A deferred libraryâ€™s constants arenâ€™t constants in the importing file. Remember, these constants donâ€™t exist until the deferred library is loaded.
    - You canâ€™t use types from a deferred library in the importing file. Instead, consider moving interface types to a library imported by both the deferred library and the importing file.
    - Dart implicitly inserts loadLibrary() into the namespace that you define using `deferred as namespace`.
    - The loadLibrary() function returns a Future.

### Async

- Avoid callback hell and make your code much more readable by using `async` and `await`.
  ```javascript
  const oneSecond = Duration(seconds: 1);
  Future<void> printWithDelay(String message) async {
    await Future.delayed(oneSecond);
    print(message);
  }
  printWithDelay('Async function');
  ```

### Entry Point

- `main()` function accepts optional `List<String>` param

  ```javascript
  void main() {
    print('Dart has $s, which is very handy.');
    print('That deserves all caps ${s.toUpperCase()} is very handy!');

    // Creating map with Map()
    nobleGases1[2] = 'helium';
    nobleGases1[10] = 'neon';
    nobleGases1[18] = 'argon';
    // Use .length to get the number of key-value pairs in the map:

    // Adding elements to the set
    elements.addAll(halogens);
    elements.add('fluorine'); -  removes the duplicate value added to set

    print('Lenght of a set is: ${elements.length}');

    print(nav);
    print(listOfStrings);

    // Runes examples
    var clapping = '\u{1f44f}';
    print(clapping);
    print(clapping.codeUnits);
    print(clapping.runes.toList());

    Runes input = new Runes(
        '\u2665  \u{1f605}  \u{1f60e}  \u{1f47b}  \u{1f596}  \u{1f44d}');
    print(new String.fromCharCodes(input));

    // using functions
    var result = fibonacci(20);
    print('Fibonacci(20): $result');

    // example of calling  function without the optional parameter:
    assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy') == 'Bob says Howdy');

    // bold will be true; hidden will be false.
    enableFlags1(bold: true);

    // Create a function that adds 2.
    var add2 = makeAdder(2);

    // Create a function that adds 4.
    var add4 = makeAdder(4);

    print('Closure example:');
    print(add2(3));
    print(add4(3));

    // Using loops
    // Closures inside of Dartâ€™s for loops capture the value of the index, avoiding a common pitfall found in JavaScript. For example, consider:
    print('Closures inside dart capture the value of the index: ');
    var callbacks = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      callbacks.add(() => print(i));
    }
    callbacks.forEach((c) => c());

    // The output is 0 and then 1, as expected. In contrast, the example would print 2 and then 2 in JavaScript.
  }
  ```
