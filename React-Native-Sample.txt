# Ways to create react-native apps:

  1.  Using react-native-cli -> requires android studio needs to be installed
      $ npm install -g react-native-cli

      Create an app using,
      $ react-native init AwesomeProject

      Run the project in emulator or device
      $ react-native run-android

  2.  Using create-react-native-app (CRNA) - Doesn't require android studio, but needs expo client on devices to be tested
      Needs to be in the same Wi-Fi network to run the app and test it
      check expo.io for documentation, apps can be created using expo and other libraries,

      Create an app using,
      $ create-react-native-app SampleApp

      Run the project in emulator,
      $ npm run android
